Example Materials Used by a Piano Lab Instructor
------------------------------------------------

The materials for the piano lab are varied. Many students, as we have seen, are not truly beginners at the piano. Beyond the basic scales, triads and arpeggios, cadences and method pieces, the repertoire and technical exercises will be custom-tailored for each student during the semester.
